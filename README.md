# ChallengePost Scraper

The ChallengePost scraper is a utility that serves to fetch project data from ChallengePost while the developers at ChallengePost build an API.

The scraper was used for gathering past winning project data to for training a program to predict a project's chances of winning. You can view the project on ChallengePost [here](http://challengepost.com/software/paradox-calculator). The scraper is written with Python 3 and is run with Anaconda. It uses the numpy and scipy modules for training the program. This project served as an interesting look into the realm of machine learning.
