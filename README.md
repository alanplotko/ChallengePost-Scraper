# ChallengePost Scraper

The ChallengePost scraper is a utility that serves to fetch project data from ChallengePost. After talking with ChallengePost staff, it seems that the developers are working on an API. In the meantime, this utility will serve in the place of an API for the Paradox Calculator project completed at the HackRPI hackathon.

The scraper was used for gathering past winning project data to for training a program to predict a project's chances of winning. You can view the project on ChallengePost [here](http://challengepost.com/software/paradox-calculator). The scraper is written with Python 3 and runs with Anaconda. It uses the numpy and scipy modules for training the program. This project served as an interesting look into the realm of machine learning. I worked on the scraper for gathering test data and my teammate, @hallfox, worked on the machine learning component. I later integrated some of his code with my scraper to allow us to input a ChallengePost project's URL. The utility outputs the chances of the project winning based on the algorithm we put together.
